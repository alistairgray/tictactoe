## How it was built
I used HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery to build this game

## Features / Things to Know
In this game you are playing against a simple A.I., who has been assigned the 'X' symbol. You have been assigned the 'O' symbol.
<br />
You will get the first pick and the A.I. will respond with their own.
<br />
The game will continue until either you or the A.I. has achieved three symbols in a row, otherwise a draw will be called. You then have the option of playing another round.
## Bugs
There are no known bugs although I am experimenting with how long the A.I. is allowed to pause and think about it's next move.
## Planned Features
+ Ability for the player to choose a symbol and avatar for themselves and their opponent
+ Experiment with creating a more sophisticated A.I.

## My own experience developing the game
Overall I found the whole process highly rewarding. There is still so much to learn but I found that I am grasping advanced concepts faster and faster. Ironically the most simple tasks would cause me difficulty, for example I spent a considerable amount of time not understanding why my background images would not print.
<br />
The answer was a simple ../ before the url already entered. My conclusion out of this project is that Javascript and more logic based languages appeal rather than the cursed, illogical CSS. Ha!
<br />
I am looking forward to the next challenge with great interest.
